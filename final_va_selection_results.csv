During my bachelor's, I researched at the Biofuel and Bioproduct Lab, focusing on Waste to Worth, Zero Waste, and the Circular Economy. I developed an integrated system combining crop cultivation with waste recycling, including mushroom cultivation, biomaterial and bioleather production, anaerobic digestion, composting, and wastewater treatment.
I have conducted experiments transforming crop and campus waste into valuable products, producing biogas for cooking, heating, and electricity.

Our system is designed to meet the unique needs of the Tajik healthcare system and can be easily adapted to other Central Asian countries. With our software as a service (SaaS) subscription model, we make it easy for medical facilities to implement our EHR system without the high upfront costs and maintenance associated with traditional on-premise systems. By using our EHR system, medical facilities in Tajikistan can improve patient care and increase efficiency, while also ensuring compliance with national and international regulations. In the future, we plan to expand our services to other Central Asian countries, making our EHR system available to even more medical professionals in the region.

However, it was because of the increased popularity that the financial success of the project came at doubt. I earned more but I had to spend 99 percent of the revenue. The inflow of students and the constant aspiration to keep the quality of education at high level created big operational expenses: teachers’ training, constant quality monitoring, and technical support. However, the biggest problem was when after gaining enough training and experience the teachers would want to work independently. Round after round, I had to invest time, energy, and money in new teachers only to see how they leave the company. The project was not profitable. I closed it and took a break to rethink the sustainability strategy. I spent next year doing research and came to understand the other side: the teachers.

The team has been working not only to provide tech features that make financial management easier, but also to create an ecosystem around the product suite that allows for knowledge transfer. Features and technological innovation is explained in more detail in the next question.","Real-time insights and metric tracking: Even businesses that have an accountant struggle to use their own data for decision-making because financial reporting is cyclical and massively delayed. Also, most SME founders neither know the importance of, nor know how to compute or track, their business metrics. Both these issues are solved by Metric, where critical metrics are being calculated and tracked for businesses automatically and in real-time, allowing for immediate decision-making that helps businesses grow.  Simplicity of input: The aim has always been to make Metric the world’s most founder-friendly business finance app, and for this to happen it is critical that the input of transaction data is as simple as possible. For this, the team is constantly working on various integrations (banks, Shopify, POS systems, etc) so that the founder has to do less effort and even less knowledge or skills are required.  Digital Vouchers: Founders that use Metric are able to upload photos of their receipts and invoices, thereby creating digital vouchers for record keeping. Invoices can also be sent to vendors or clients digitally, decreasing the use of paper, and contributing to the environment.  One Picture Accounting ™: Metric uses AI/ML-based tech to offer One Picture Accounting ™ - a feature that allows business owners to simply take photos of their receipts or invoices, and their accounting is done! Not only are these invoices/receipts saved as digital vouchers, our tech also reads these images and logs relevant information into the company’s accounts. This makes accounting extremely simple as well as fast, allowing for a lot more financial inclusion (people who are unable to perhaps add input manually due to lack of knowledge), and saves the entrepreneurs’ time. Metric’s CTO is a Ph.D. in AI/ML and has been working on projects around this all her career.  Sectoral insights: A massive issue in Pakistan and other emerging markets is the lack of real data, especially secondary data, which makes business decision-making extremely difficult. Because businesses are inputting their transaction data into Metric, while the Metric team (or anyone else) has no line of sight to individual data (company privacy is maintained fully), the layer that Metric will build on top is business insights based on anonymized sectoral data. For example, a business selling cakes in Karachi can be told what the average order value of similar businesses in similar regions is, or what the average customer acquisition cost for that sector is. This will allow businesses to make better decisions, and grow faster.  Educational elements: Metric’s founders and team understand that especially in emerging markets such as Pakistan financial education is as critical as a financial product itself. To this end, there are already educational pieces built into the app. For example, anywhere in the app where there is a typical accounting or financial term, this term can be clicked, and a video pops up where the term is explained, and the relevance of the term/metric for the business is also explained. Over time, these videos will be expanded, and more languages will also be added. A “CEO Club” will also be integrated, which will be a forum where entrepreneurs can ask each other questions, and find solutions to their problems locally through the community.",21420,21420.0,"Rs. 77,744,609-/-",test,-,Onboarding,Invited,120.0,0.0,Bachelors,5.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.25,3.25,1.75,1.0,1.0,3.75,3.9375,78.75,Accepted,False,Accepted,,Accepted,False,1,1,1,1
